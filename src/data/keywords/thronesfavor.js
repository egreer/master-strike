    "The power of the Inhuman Kingdom and the Kree and Shi'ar interstellar empires is truly vast. During Marvel's “War of Kings“ storyline, influence over these empires shifts frequently as Black Bolt, Vulcan, Ronan the Accuser, Lilandra, Gladiator, and eventually Maximus battle for supremacy. This is represented by a game concept called the “Throne's Favor.“"
