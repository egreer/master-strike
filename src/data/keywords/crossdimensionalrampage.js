This includes any Red Hulk, She-Hulk, Red She-Hulk, Skaar, Son of Hulk, Joe Fixit Grey Hulk, Hulkling, Hulk Gang, Cosmic Hulk Robot, Hulkbuster, Enchain the Hulk, and so on."

        "You don’t need to know the whole history of Marvel comics to judge who counts as a Hulk – just rely on whether the card says Hulk in its name or not. There are only a few, very specific exceptions we have to make to stay true to the characters: “Nul, Breaker of Worlds” from Fear Itself and “Maestro” (core set) count as Hulks for this."

        "Some Heroes can transform into Hulks, like Bruce Banner and Amadeus Cho. A puny “Bruce Banner” card doesn’t say “Hulk” on it, so it can’t stop a Hulk Rampage. But revealing the transformed Bruce Banner card named “Savage Hulk Unleashed” works."
