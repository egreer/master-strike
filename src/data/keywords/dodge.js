    "“Dodge” means “During your turn, you may discard this card from your hand to draw another card.” This ability represents the trickiness and resourcefulness of the Villainous Allies. Many Dodge cards have conditional effects so that sometimes you want to play them, and sometimes you want to Dodge them away. Dodge also helps you sculpt your hand towards Recruit Points or Attack as you desire."
