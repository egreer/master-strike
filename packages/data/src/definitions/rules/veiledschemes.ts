    "The enemies of mutantkind often hide their true goals until it's too late. All 4 Schemes in this set are “Veiled Schemes.” They say “Unveiled Scheme” on the reverse side. When you use any of these Scheme cards, start with the “Veiled Scheme” side face up. At a certain point, it will say “This Scheme Transforms into a random Unveiled Scheme.” This means you remove the Veiled Scheme from the game and replace it with a randomly selected “Unveiled Scheme” from all the ones you own. You might randomly select the reverse side of the Veiled Scheme you started with, or you might randomly select the Unveiled Scheme side of a different card."
